# Battle-of-Neighborhoods

This is my project Battle of Neighborhoods in which I used the Foursquare location data to analyze the neighborhoods of four different cities New York, Toronto, Beijing and Shanghai. These cities are the economic or political center of the countries. I wish to find similar neighborhoods among these cities and provide some useful information for people who are considering moving among Canada, USA and China.

It includes the neighborhood names I extracted online:
    1.Beijing.csv
    2.new_york.json
    3.Shanghai.csv
    4.toronto.csv

The neighborhood location data using Nominatim API:
    1.bj_neighborhoods.csv
    2.ny_neighborhoods.csv
    3.sh_neighborhoods.csv
    4.toronto_neighborhoods.csv

The nearby venues data extracted using Foursquare API:
    1.bj_venues.csv
    2.ny_venues.csv
    3.sh_venues.csv
    4.toronto_venues.csv
    
My test analysis for Toronto:

    3.Toronto_clustering.ipynb
